This repository contains data and code associated with my 1/10/2021 
Towards Data Science blog post titled "End to end Shiny app tutorial using NYC mortality data."
Raw and cleaned data files are contained within the "data" folder, and cleaning is conducted
in the nyc_death_cleaning.Rmd file. The Shiny app, as well as a copy of the cleaned data, are 
contained within the nyc_death folder.
